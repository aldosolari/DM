This course aims to provide statistical and computational tools for *data mining* and *supervised learning* by using the R software environment for statistical computing. Special emphasis is given to applied predictive modelling. 

The goal of *predictive modeling* is to construct models that generate accurate predictions for future, yet-to-be-seen data. The process of developing an effective model is both iterative and heuristic. This framework includes exploratory data analysis, splitting the data into training and testing sets, building models, selecting an approach for identifying optimal tuning parameters, and estimating predictive performance.

Participating in predictive modelling *competitions* can help you gain practical experience and  improve your data modelling skills in various domains such as credit, insurance, marketing, sales' forecasting etc.  At the same time you get to do it in a competitive context against dozens of participants where each one tries to build the most predictive algorithm. Since 2015, this course utilises [BeeViva](http://www.bee-viva.com/competitions), the __first__ Italian public data platform for hosting [#Competitions](#competitions).

The lecture notes and course webpage were created with [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).
All of the course material is on the [github repo](https://github.com/aldosolari/DM). 
Download the .Rmd files, modify as you like and decide the output format (PDF, HTML or Word). To extract the R code from a .Rmd file use

```{r, eval=F, echo=TRUE}
knitr::purl("../filename.Rmd")
```


We will use R Markdown quite a bit in the class, and its use is __required__ for the Test (in lab) where the data analysis must be solved with R Markdown by generating an HTML file, which will be uploaded to the "CONSEGNA" folder.

You can read more about R Markdown in [Chapter 27 of r4ds](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/r-markdown.html#r-markdown-basics). This [document](https://m-clark.github.io/Introduction-to-Rmarkdown/) may be helpful to get started with R Markdown.
R Markdown is an example of [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming), a concept introduced by Donald Knuth saying _you should write code that communicates primarily to humans, not computers_.


# Reading

**Books**

There are two primary references:

# Competitions

Please read carefully the [competition instructions](https://aldosolari.github.io/DM/).
Time window for joining the competitions:

| Competition | Problem | Period |  
|----|----|----|
| [Netflix data](docs/competitions/Missc/Missc.html) | Regression | 21.10.19 - 15.11.19 |
| OkCupid data | Classification |  21.10.19 - 15.11.19 |

If a student does not take part in the competitions in the above time window, he/she must

* contact the teacher via e-mail before the exam and get new training/test data
* send via e-mail the predictions in the required format  
* publish on github the (reproducible) R code at least one week before the exam

The [competition platform](http://www.bee-viva.com/competitions) is provided by BeeViva s.r.l. (University of Padua spin-off). I would like to thank BeeViva and in particular [Livio Finos](http://www.liviofinos.net/), [Dario Solari](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dariosolari/?originalSubdomain=it) and [Tomaso "Minni" Minelli](https://github.com/minni). The competitions offered in this course would not have been possible without their constant and precious support.


# Exams

The exam consists of two parts:

  * **Test** (in Lab)
  * **Competitions** (Homework)
  
Test calendar :

| N.ro | Date | Lab | Hours |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 18.11.19 | TBD | 14:00 | 
| 2 | 30.1.20 | TBD | 14:00 | 
| 3 | 13.2.20 | TBD | 14:00 | 


The **Test** consists of

* **questions** about the theory (open and/or multiple-choice)
* **data analysis** with R 

For the data analysis, the following R code will be available in the "TESTO" folder:

* [Code from ISLR](https://aldosolari.github.io/DM/exams/codeISLR.pdf)

For the data analysis, you have to write the R code in a .Rmd file and then use the **Knit** button to generate an HTML file, which will be uploaded to the "CONSEGNA" folder. Other formats will not be accepted.
