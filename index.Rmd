This course aims to provide statistical and computational tools for *data mining* and *supervised learning* by using the R software environment for statistical computing. Special emphasis is given to applied predictive modelling. 

The goal of *predictive modeling* is to construct models that generate accurate predictions for future, yet-to-be-seen data. The process of developing an effective model is both iterative and heuristic. This framework includes exploratory data analysis, splitting the data into training and testing sets, building models, selecting an approach for identifying optimal tuning parameters, and estimating predictive performance.

Participating in predictive modelling *competitions* can help you gain practical experience and  improve your data modelling skills in various domains such as credit, insurance, marketing, sales' forecasting etc.  At the same time you get to do it in a competitive context against dozens of participants where each one tries to build the most predictive algorithm. Since 2015, this course utilises [BeeViva](http://www.bee-viva.com/competitions), one of the first Italian public data platforms for hosting [#Competitions](#competitions). 

See the **[course syllabus](https://aldosolari.github.io/DM/syllabus/syllabus.html)** for more information.

# **Competitions**

The [competition platform](http://www.bee-viva.com/competitions) is provided by BeeViva s.r.l. (University of Padua spin-off).

If you click on a specific Competition in the listing, you will go to the Competition's homepage. The following information is provided in the tabs:

1. *Description* gives a description of the problem
2. *Data* is where you can download the data splitted into training set and test set
3. *Evaluation* describes how to format your submission file and how your submissions will be evaluated. Each competition employs a metric (RMSE, Accuracy, etc.) that serves as the objective measure for how competitors are ranked on the leaderboard.
4. *Timeline* for joining the competition: an entry deadline and a submission deadline (after which no new submissions will be accepted). After the deadline passes, partecipants get a final score.
5. *Leaderboard*. Submissions can be made through through manual upload in the competition platform. Submissions are scored immediately and summarized on a live leaderboard.


| Competition | Problem | Entry | Submission | 
|---|---|----|----|
| Houses prices | Regression | October 8 | November 16  |
| OkCupid | Classification | October 15 | November 16 |
| TBD | TBD | October 15 | November 16  |
