# Class Imbalance
### Aldo Solari

# Outline

* Introduction
* 

---

* With class predictions, a common summary method is to produce a confusion matrix which is a simple cross-tabulation between the observed and predicted classes

* Accuracy is the most obvious metric for characterizing the performance of models

* However, it suffers when there is a class imbalance; suppose 95% of the data have a specific class. 95% accuracy can be achieved by predicting samples to be the majority class

* There are measures that correct for the natural event rate, such as Cohen's Kappa

---

# Two classes

* There are a number of specialized metrics that can be used when there are two classes. Usually, one of these classes can be considered the event of interest or the positive class.

* One common way to think about performance is to consider false negatives and false positives.
    - the sensitivity is the true positive rate
    - the specificity is the rate of correctly predicted negatives, or 1 - false positive rate.

From this, assuming that Class1 is the event of interest:

---

# Conditional and Unconditional Measures

Sensitivity and specificity can be computed from the sens and spec functions, respectively.

It should be noted that these are conditional measures since we need to know the true outcome.

The event rate is the prevalence (or the Bayesian prior). Sensitivity and specificity analogous to the likelihood values.

There are unconditional analogs to the posterior values called the positive predictive values and the negative predicted values.

A variety of other measures are available for two class systems, especially for information retrieval.

One thing to consider: what happens if our threshold to call a sample an event is not optimal?
