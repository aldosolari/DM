# The course


* This course aims to provide **statistical** and **computational** tools for data mining and supervised learning by using the R software environment for statistical computing

* In particular, you will learn how to use **statistical (machine) learning** for buildind **predictive models** that generate accurate predictions for future, yet-to-be-seen data

* This framework includes 
    - data visualization
    - exploratory data analysis
    - feature engineering
    - splitting the data into training and testing sets
    - building models
    - selecting an approach for identifying optimal tuning parameters
    - estimating predictive performance

---

# Exam

* The exams consists of two parts:

    - **Test** (in lab)
        - Questions about theory (open and/or multiple choice)
        - Data Analysis in R 
  
    - **Competitions** (homework)
        - Attending students can form a team (max. 3 persons)

* The final grade is a weighted average of Test (25% Questions, 25% Data Analysis) and Competitions (50%)

* You must reach a **minimum passing score** for the Questions 

---


# Competitions

* Participating in predictive modelling __competitions__ can help you gain practical experience and improve your data modelling skills in various domains such as credit, insurance, marketing, sales' forecasting etc. 

* At the same time you get to do it in a competitive context against dozens of participants where each one tries to build the most predictive algorithm

* Inspired by [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), the world's largest community of data scientists and machine learners

* Since 2015, this course utilises [BeeViva](http://www.bee-viva.com/competitions), an Italian public data platform for hosting competitions

* Beeviva is also used for the event [Stats Under the Stars](http://sus.stat.unipd.it/)

# Two goals

Leo Breiman (2001) says

> Statistics starts with data. Think of the data as being generated by a black box in
which a vector of input variables $x$ go in one side, and on the
other side the response variables $y$ come out. Inside the black box, nature functions to
associate the predictor variables with the response variables...
There are two goals in analyzing the data:

1. **Prediction**
To be able to predict what the responses are going to be to future input
variables
  - Machine learning algorithms
  - 2% of the academic statisticians
  
2. **Inference** 
To infer how nature is associating the response variables to the input variables
  - Stochastic models (true model generating the data)
  - 98% of the academic statisticians

---

# To explain or to predict?

**True model**

$$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \varepsilon$$

**Underspecified model**

$$Y = \gamma_0+ \gamma_1 X_1 + \epsilon$$

Explanation requires estimating the coefficients of the true model,
but **a wrong model can sometimes predict better**:
  - when the predictors $X_1$ and $X_2$ are highly correlated
  - when the data are very noisy
  - when $\beta_2$ is small

# What the computer is thinking

* Four last throws

    - **PAPER, SCISSORS, SCISSORS, ROCK** <- HUMAN 

    - **SCISSORS, PAPER, PAPER, SCISSORS** <- COMPUTER

* COMPUTER is going to search over 200,000 rounds of Rock-Paper-Scissors data and find
all the times that HUMAN played **P, S, S, R**  when COMPUTER played **S, P, P, S**

* Of all the times HUMANS played **P, S, S, R**  when COMPUTER played **S, P, P, S**, HUMANS played **PAPER** at their next throw the most. 

* COMPUTER thinks that you will do the same this time

# Is this machine learning or statistics?

* **Theorem** 
A truly random game would result in a tie

* **Hypothesis** 
A human is not truly random

* **Algorithm** 
Learn humans non-random patterns from the data

* **Counter-attack?**

# Working together

* Leo Breiman's fundamental contributions:
    - Bagging
    - Random Forests
    - Boosting

* Breiman's work helped to bridge the gap between statistical
modeling and machine learning

* __Statistical Learning__ = __Statistical__ Modeling + Machine __Learning__

---

# Statistical learning

* **Unsupervised learning**
    - the data consists of $p$ variables $X_1,\ldots,X_p$; no variable has a special status
    - the goal is 
          - clustering
          - dimensionality reduction
          - etc.

* **Supervised learning**
    - the data consists of both response $Y$ and predictors $X_1,\ldots,X_p$
    - the problem is called supervised learning since the response supervises the learning process
    - the goal is prediction of the response
        - $Y$ continuous : __regression__ problem 
        - $Y$ binary/multi-class : __classification__ problem

# Statistics ⊂ Data science

> While statistics - as the science of learning from data -
is necessary for turning data into knowledge and action,
it's not the only critical component within data science

> When statistics, database management, and
distributed/parallel computing combine, we will see
growth in cross-trained experts who are better equipped
to solve complex challenges in today's massive data
revolution

# Key word

Most people hyping Data Science have focused on the first word:
Data

> The key word in "Data Science" is not Data, it is Science

> Jeff Leek 

Data Science is only useful when the data are used to answer a
scientific question

# Gauss' problems

__Astronomy problem__ 

Predict the position of the asteroid Ceres at 31 December 1801 on the basis of data provided by the italian astronomer Giuseppe Piazzi

__Statistical problem__

Find $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ such that minimizes $(\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta})^\mathsf{T}(\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta})$

Gauss solution: least squares $\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}=(\mathbf{X}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{X}^\mathsf{T} \mathbf{y}$


__Computational problem__

Solve (by hand!) the system of equations $\mathbf{X}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta} = \mathbf{X}^\mathsf{T} \mathbf{y}$

Gauss solution: fast optimization algorithm (Gaussian elimination)

# Training set and test set

* From AS, chapter 3 (Yesterday-tomorrow data)

* Yesterday we observed $n=30$ pairs of data, the __training set__
$$(x_1,y_1), (x_2,y_2), \ldots, (x_n,y_n)$$ 

* Tomorrow we will observe $n=30$ pairs of data, the __test set__
$$(x_1,y^*_1), (x_2,y^*_2), \ldots, (x_n,y^*_n)$$

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(readr)
df <- read_table2("http://azzalini.stat.unipd.it/Book-DM/yesterday.dat")[-31,]
head(data.frame(x.train=df$x, y.train=df$y.yesterday, x.test=df$x, y.test=NA))
```

# Fixed-X view

For simplicity:

* the training predictor values $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ are treated as fixed (i.e. non-random)
* the test predictor values $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ exactly match the the training predictor values $x_1,\ldots,x_n$

Reading: 
[Rosset and Tibshirani (2018)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.08160.pdf)

The responses in training data were generated artificially by 
$$Y_i = f(x_i)+ \varepsilon_i, \quad i=1,\ldots,n$$
and the responses in test data by
$$Y^*_{i}=f(x_i)+\varepsilon^*_i, \quad i=1,\ldots,n$$
where $\varepsilon_1,\ldots,\varepsilon_n$ and $\varepsilon^*_1,\ldots,\varepsilon^*_n$ are i.i.d. $N(0,\sigma^2)$ with $\sigma=0.01$ and $f$ is a function which we leave unspecified

```{r}
# import data
library(readr)
{{df <- read_table2("http://azzalini.stat.unipd.it/Book-DM/yesterday.dat")[-31,]}}
train <- data.frame(x=df$x, y=df$y.yesterday)
test <- data.frame(x=df$x, y=df$y.tomorrow)

# scatterplot
plot( y ~ x , train)
```

---

# Mean squared error

* Suppose we have estimated $f$ by $\hat{f}$

* For yesterday data (training set), we can compute the __mean squared error__ 
$$\mathrm{MSE}_{\mathrm{Tr}} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \hat{f}(x_i))^2$$ 

* However, we would like to have a good performance on tomorrow data (test set)
$$\mathrm{MSE}_{\mathrm{Te}} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}( y^*_i - \hat{f}(x_i))^2$$ 


---

# Polynomials


* Consider the polynomial regression model of degree $d$
$$f(x) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \beta_2 x^2 + \ldots + \beta_d x^{d}$$

* Use the training set to get the estimate 
$$\hat{f}(x)=\hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 x + \hat{\beta}_2 x^2 + \ldots + \hat{\beta}_d x^{d}$$ and predict tomorrow $y_i^*$ by using
$$\hat{y}_i^*=\hat{f}(x_i), \quad i=1,\ldots,n$$

* Find the degree $d$ that minimizes the expected value of  $\mathrm{MSE}_{\mathrm{Te}}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}( y^*_i - \hat{f}(x_i))^2$
