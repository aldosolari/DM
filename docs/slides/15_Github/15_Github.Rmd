# Github

* GitHub Inc. is a web-based hosting service for version control using Git

* In 2018, [Microsoft](https://blog.github.com/2018-06-04-github-microsoft/) acquired GitHub for US$7.5 billion

* This is a step-by-step beginner's guide to creating a personal website and hosting it for free using GitHub Pages

---

# HTML file

* At this point I'm assuming you have produced HTML file with Rmarkdown containing the description of the analysis and the R code used in the last submission

* Here is an [example](https://aldosolari.github.io/DM/docs/competitions/publish_example.html)

* We will see how to publish your HTML file on GitHub Pages

# What is Git, GitHub, and GitHub Pages?

Very shortly:

* __Git__ is a version control system that tracks changes to files in a project over time

* __GitHub__ is a web hosting service for the source code of software and web development projects that use Git

* __GitHub Pages__ are public webpages hosted for free through GitHub

---

# Getting Started with GitHub Pages

Sign in to GitHub


On your profile, go to __Repositories__ tab and click __New__

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '67%', out.height = '67%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/new_repo.png")
```

---

Create a new repository named __{username}.github.io__

Make sure to initialize the repository with a README file

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '60%', out.height = '60%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/repo_io.png")
```

---

# {username}.github.io

Congrats! You just built your first GitHub Pages site

View it at https://{username}.github.io

Usually the first time your GitHub Pages site is created it takes 5-10 minutes to go live

Now we will create a new repository containing the HTML file

---

Create a new repository named e.g. DMcompetitions 

Make sure to initialize the repository with a README file

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '60%', out.height = '60%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/create_repo.jpg")
```

---

Once youâ€™re in your new repository, click __Upload files__

![](images/new_repo.jpg)

---

Drag and drop in your HTML file and click __Commit changes__:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '67%', out.height = '67%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/upload_files.jpg")
```

---

Next to Upload files, click __Create new file__

Name it __.nojekyll__ and click Commit new file

This tells GitHub Pages to not process your site with the Jekyll engine

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '100%', out.height = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/nojekyll.jpg")
```

---

Go to the __Settings__ tab of your repository

Scroll down to the Github Pages section and click __None__

Select __master branch__ as your Source and then hit __Save__

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '67%', out.height = '67%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/pages.jpg")
```

Navigate to {username}.github.io/{reponame}/{filename}.html
