# House Prices

* This competition uses the Ames IA housing data. There are 2930 properties in the data. The sale price was recorded along with 81 predictors, including:

    - Location (e.g. neighborhood) and lot information.
    - House components (garage, fireplace, pool, porch, etc.).
    - General assessments such as overall quality and condition.
    - Number of bedrooms, baths, and so on. 

* The training set has `\(n=1460\)`, the test set has `\(m=1470\)`.

* More details can be found in [De Cock (2011, Journal of Statistics Education)](http://ww2.amstat.org/publications/jse/v19n3/decock.pdf).

* See also the Kaggle competition [House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)

* Team: No

* Weight: 1/3

# Data

The training data has 82 columns which include 23 nominal, 23 ordinal, 14 discrete, and 20 continuous variables (and 2 additional observation identifiers). Hereâ€™s a brief version of what you'll find in the data description file:

# Evaluation

* Submissions are evaluated on __Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error__ (RMSLE) between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price

`$$\mathrm{RMSLE}= \sqrt{\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}\left[\log(y^*_i)- \log(\hat{y}_i)\right]^2}$$`


* Taking logs means that errors in predicting expensive houses and cheap houses will affect the result equally

* During the competition, the leaderboard displays your partial score, which is the RMSLE for `\(m=735\)` (random) houses of the test set. At the end of the contest, the leaderboard will display the final score, which is the RMSLE for the remaining `\(m=735\)` houses of the test set. The final score will determine the final winner. This method prevents users from overfitting to the leaderboard

The __points__ will be calculated on the basis of the distribution of the competition' scores

![](Houseprices_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

```
Benchmark score 21.32 
 Benchmark % of points: 3.62 %
```



However, I reserve the right to regrade differently (meaning your % of points may be calculated differently)

# Benchmark



```r
train &lt;- read.csv("60.csv", stringsAsFactors=T)
test &lt;- read.csv("61.csv", stringsAsFactors=F)

fit &lt;- lm(log10(SalePrice) ~ Year.Built + Lot.Area + Gr.Liv.Area, data = train)
yhat = 10^predict(fit, newdata=test)

write.table(file="mySubmission.txt", yhat, row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE)
```
